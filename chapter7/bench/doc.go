package bench

/*
   bench is a cryptographic benchmark package.

   This is a sample benchmark package demonstrating the compuational cost
   of public key cryptography compared to symmetric cryptography. It
   compares the cost of generating keys, and encrypting/decrypting a short
   string.

   Symmetric: AES128-CTR
   Asymmetric: RSA 3072 OAEP
