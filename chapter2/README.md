# Chapter 2: Symmetric Security

This package contains examples for using the ciphersuites covered in
chapter 2. Unless otherwise noted, they generate random nonces for
each message. They also all use the package name "secret", so that they
can easily be swapped out into a system.

The packages here:

* nacl
* aesgcm
