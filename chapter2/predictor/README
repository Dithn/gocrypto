challenger is a challenger in the IND-CPA game with a predictable IV
generator. It runs an HTTP server, listening on port 8080, and accepts
queries on one of two endpoints:

	- /query takes a JSON structure with two elements ("m1" and "m2")
	  that contains the two messages for the challenger to encrypt.
	  The challenger will choose a single message and return the
	  hex-encoded version back to the attacker.
	- /choose takes a JSON structure with a single element ("first"),
	  which contains a boolean that is true if the last ciphertext
	  returned is for the first message. The challenger will return
	  "1" if this is correct, or "0" if not.
