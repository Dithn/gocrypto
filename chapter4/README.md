# Chapter 4: Secure Channels and Key Exchange

This package contains examples for the key exchange techniques mentioned
in chapter 4. It builds on the ciphersuites in chapter3. 

* naclbox: secure messages using ephemeral Curve25519 keys
* nistecdh: key exchange using ECDH with the NIST curves
* passcrypt: derive encryption keys using passwords via Scrypt
* session: a much more worked out session example than in the book that
  prevents message replay
