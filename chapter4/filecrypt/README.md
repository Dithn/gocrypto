## filecrypt

This is my implementation of the exercise at the end of Chapter 4. It
is a simple passphrase-based file encryption tool.

Usage: ./filecrypt [-de] [-in infile] [-out outfile]
        -d      decrypt infile to outfile
        -e      encrypt infile to outfile
        -in     the input file
        -out    the output file
