hybrid crypto system

This is an example of a hybrid cryptosystem. It uses RSA to encrypt a set of
ephemeral symmetric encryption keys, and transmits the resulting ciphertext
along with the ciphertext resulting from an authenticated symmetric encryption
of the message with AES-128 in CTR mode with an HMAC-SHA256 message tag. The
receiver decrypts the ephemeral keys and verifies the sender's signature of the
keys. This ensures that the sender is allowed to communicate with the host. If
this is successful, the reciever then decrypts the symmetric ciphertext and
validates the HMAC.

The use of ephemeral keys ensures that, in the event the symmetric keys
are compromised, they do not jeopardize future communications.

For more information, see the chapter on hybrid cryptosystems. The primary
purpose of this README is to provide a test message that is longer than
the supported RSA message length to demonstrate how we can leverage the
advantages of both symmetric and public-key cryptography.

Example keys for the sender (testdata/1.key) and the receiver
(testdata/2.key) are provided to avoid the extra time spent generating
RSA keys.
