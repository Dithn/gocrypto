hybrid crypto system

This is an example of a hybrid cryptosystem. It uses Diffie-Hellman
keys to generate shared encryption and HMAC keys. Unlike with the RSA
example, it does not transmit any keys as part of the message, which
is encrypted with AES-128 in CTR mode with an HMAC-SHA256 message tag.

This version uses a key-encryption key to use per-message
content-encryption keys.

For more information, see the chapter on hybrid cryptosystems (chapter 9 of
Practical Cryptography with Go[1]).
