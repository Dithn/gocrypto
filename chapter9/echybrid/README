hybrid crypto system

This is an example of a hybrid cryptosystem. It uses elliptic curve keys
to generate shared symmetric encryption and HMAC keys. It uses ephemeral
keys for the sender, providing forward secrecy.

For more information, see the chapter on hybrid cryptosystems (chapter 9 of
Practical Cryptography with Go[1]).
